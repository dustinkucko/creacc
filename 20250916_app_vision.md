# App Vision

A creative engine (content and context system) that enables humans and agents to collaboratively create, manage, and deploy branded content at scale.
- A web app that connects brand copy (Markdown/HTML) and assets (media files) in a unified way.
- All content (media assets) and context (copy/notes/text) live in a `space` with an owner.
- Store campaigns, creatives, collections, products, etc.
- Agents leverage the content and context system to generate new content and manage existing assets.
- Git versioning and hooks will support the system by structuring copy as it relates to assets.

## Functionality Requirements

- **Front-End Editor**: Simple editor for artists and non-technical teammates.
- **Code Editor Integration**: Simple interface for developers and agents.
- **Knowledge Integration**: Built-in brand guidelines, rules, approved language, and formatting.
- **Contextual Retrieval**: Store relationships in a knowledge graph data model to connect assets.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Unify content and context for agent and human use.

## Nice-to-Haves

- **Static Site Generation**: Act as a CMS to provide content for static site generation.
- **Shopify Integration**: Update fields automatically.
