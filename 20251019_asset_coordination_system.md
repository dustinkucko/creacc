# Asset Coordination System

Most people need a simple, reliable path from idea to publish‑ready assets without losing files, versions, or brand quality.

Core requirements for a creative system:
- Single source of truth: central library for all assets and variants.
- Fast findability: tags, collections, search, previews, and metadata.
- Versioning and approvals: track edits, comment, compare, and approve.
- Brand consistency: brand kits, locked styles, fonts, and color tokens.
- Reusable building blocks: templates, components, and snippets.
- Multi‑format output: auto‑resize, smart crops, file presets, and exports.
- Integrations: publish/export to social, CMS, ads, and dev handoff.
- Collaboration and permissions: roles, sharing links, and external reviewers.
- Rights and usage: licenses, expirations, and usage notes.
- Workflow and automation: briefs, tasks, statuses, checklists, and AI assist.
- Analytics and feedback: performance signals to inform the next iteration.
- Reliability and speed: quick uploads, conflict handling, offline sync.

Common choices:
- Small teams: Google Drive/Dropbox + templates in Canva/Figma/Adobe CC Libraries.
- Larger orgs: DAM (Bynder/Brandfolder/Adobe Experience Manager) + workflow tools (e.g., Adobe Workfront).
